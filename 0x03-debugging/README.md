Debugging is the process of detecting and removing of existing and potential errors (also called as 'bugs') in a software code that can cause it to behave unexpectedly or crash. YOU HAVE TO CRAETE YOUR PROTOTYPE ON YOUR main.h file FOR YOUR CODES TO WORK

File: 0-main.c
In most projects, we often give you only one main file to test with. For example, this main file is a test for a postitive_or_negative() function similar to the one you worked with in an earlier C project:

File: 1-main.c
Copy this main file. Comment out (donâ€™t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.

Donâ€™t add or remove any lines of code, as we will be checking your line count. You are only allowed to comment out existing code.
You do not have to compile with -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic for this task.

File: 2-largest_number.c, main.h
This program prints the largest of three integers.

File: 3-print_remaining_days.c, main.h
This program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration.


AS A PROGRAMMER, WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOU GET STUCK?
To help you track down that bug, start reading your code aloud.
Pretend that a programmer friend is sitting right next to you.
Explain what your code is doing and how it works. As you talk through your code, youâ€™ll find the problem. If you donâ€™t, have your imaginary friend ask you questions during your explanation.
Donâ€™t worry about going mental. Youâ€™re a C programmer. Youâ€™re already mental. ðŸ˜…
As a bonus, talking through your code also helps you identify which portions need to have comments and what the comments should be.
